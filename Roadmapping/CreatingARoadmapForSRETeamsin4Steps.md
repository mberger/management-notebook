Over the past decades, I’ve been part of many teams focusing on operations, infrastructure, and reliability. From one position to the next one, they were some differences but also some constants. One of the most constant issues has been the difficulty in hiring enough talented engineers. In summary, we always had to do more with less.


So, why do you need a roadmap?


One of the key elements to doing more with less is to stay laser focused. Having a good roadmap that people can rally around will go a long way in being strategic about where you spend your time.


So, how do you create a roadmap?


Creating and maintaining a roadmap is an exciting and fairly easy task to implement if you have a strategy. Here is mine: Collect, Score, Schedule, Communicate

# Step 1: Collect

The first step of the process consists in creating a backlog of projects. I recommend listing them on a single page over using a ticketing system. I love ticketing systems when working on projects and small tasks but I feel their UI and responsiveness are a bit too clunky and slow to be a good place for a backlog.

The be effective at filling up your backlog you may first want to look at (or create) a mission statement for your team. It may sound very cliché to start from a mission statement but you don’t want your team to be tackling too many projects that aren’t moving your company in the right direction.

Also, note that I usually don’t consider tasks that take under a week to qualify as “projects”.

With that in mind, here is how you can easily assemble a backlog:


1. Review your backlog from previous quarters to see if any unfinished items are still relevant.
2. Talk to your customers \n It’s always a good thing to keep in touch with the team and people you work with the most. interview your customers Once you have a good understanding of where your service needs improvement, you can start to identify specific projects that will help you achieve your goals.
3. Look at some of the key metrics such as your SLO. \n It’s important to ensure that your system can sustain the demands of your workload and meet your service level objectives (SLOs). Every now and then, you will have to take on projects to rebuild parts of your systems to sustain more load, stay within budget or keep your service as responsive as before.
4. Security  \n Look at the various security reports — don’t forget security review and routine tasks like password rotation/access key rotation and OS upgrade.
5. Ask your team \n Creating a good roadmap is better done as a team, don’t forget to include the entire when working on your roadmap

By using these methods, you will have a well-rounded backlog that includes input from customers, data-driven metrics, security, and previous initiatives that were not completed.

# Step 2: Score

When prioritizing tasks, it can be helpful to assign scores for both urgency and importance. Urgency refers to how quickly a task needs to be completed, while importance refers to how much of an impact completing the task will have on your goals or objectives. By assigning scores for both urgency and importance, you can more easily identify which tasks require immediate attention and which ones can be deferred. I like to score them with a decimal from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest score. For example, a task with a score of 0.5 for urgency and 0.4 for importance would likely take priority over a task with a score of 0.3 for urgency and 0.5 for importance. By using these metrics, you can better manage your time and resources to ensure that you are focusing on the tasks that will have the greatest impact on your goals.

Be aware that while this approach is really powerful, it comes with a couple of caveats. Scoring will be subjective, as different individuals may have different perspectives. Here too involving the team helps to overcome this issue.

# Step 3: Schedule

The third step of the process consists in scheduling the tasks that will go into achieving your objectives for the next quarter. It’s important to consider what is important and urgent when deciding which tasks to prioritize. Many people aim to balance reactive tasks with new projects in a 50/50 split, as this allows for both evolution and maintenance. However, it’s also important to include some of the important but not necessarily urgent tasks, as these are often the ones that can have the greatest long-term impact. Once you have identified your tasks, it’s important to set a start date and observe the effect. Keep in mind the disruption factor, especially in SRE teams that are often understaffed and need to move quickly without breaking the infrastructure. Finally, remember that the difference between what you want and what you achieve is often determined by the actions you take.

Keep in mind:

* Be realistic about timelines
* Don’t overcommit
* Leave room for unplanned work time.

This step is crucial to avoid burning out your team and ensure they have enough time to do quality work.

# Step 4: Communicate

Finally, it’s important to communicate your roadmap with everyone involved. This includes stakeholders, customers, and members of your team. By communicating clearly and regularly about what’s coming up on the roadmap, everyone will be on the same page and there will be fewer surprises along the way.

When communicating about your roadmap, be sure to include information about why certain tasks were prioritized over others and how they fit into the bigger picture of what you’re trying to achieve as a team. With clear communication and a well-planned roadmap in place, you’ll be well on your way to doing more with less and achieving success as a team.

# Conclusion

Having a good roadmap in place will help you focus on the most important tasks and achieve more with less. However, it’s important to keep in mind that a roadmap is not a static document; it should be updated regularly to reflect changes in your team’s objectives and priorities. With careful planning and an understanding of the goals and objectives of your team, you can create a roadmap that is both effective and efficient.
